# Dash integration for Panic Nova

This small extension provides Panic's [Nova][n] code editor integration with Kapeli's [Dash][d] offline documentation system.

It adds a single command to Nova, "Lookup in Dash," with a default keybinding of ^H. This will look up the current selection in Dash; if no text is selected, it will select the word the cursor is currently on.
